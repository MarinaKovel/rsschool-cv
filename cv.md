I currently work as a Senior Marketing Specialist at the LLC "FelOct-service" (SKODA importer in Belarus) in Minsk and I completed my studies at the Belarusian State University in Minsk, Belarus in 2009. I perceive myself as a fast-learner able to take initiative and work independently, but also as an effective team player. I believe I can offer your organization professional commitment and support.
